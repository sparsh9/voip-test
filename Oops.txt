1. Basic concepts of OOPS are :
a). Classes
b). Objects
c). Encapsulation
d). Polymorphism
e). Inheritance
f). Abstraction


2. Friend Function : Friend function is a function which is declared outside of the class but it can access all the private and protected members of class.


3. Difference : 
Class - A class is a template of creating objects in program.
Object - Object is an instance of the class.


4. Overriding : If a child class is using the same method as declared in the parent class, it is knows as Overriding.
Example - 
class Human {
    public:
    void walk(){
        cout<<"walking";
    }
};

class Male: public Human{
    public:
    void walk(){
        cout<<"Male walking";
    }
};


5. This Pointer - This pointer points and allows object to its access its address.
